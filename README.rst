Umbrella
========

ESP8266 based smart umbrella for art show


Hardware
========

Prototyping is done on the `Adafruit HUZZAH ESP8266 Breakout <https://www.adafruit.com/product/2471>`_
The adafruit documentation is available here: https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-huzzah-esp8266-breakout/overview


Software
========

The program will be written in eLua (NodeMCU) instead of Arduino because the `documentation <http://nodemcu.readthedocs.io/en/master/>`_ appears to be more concise.
